# world-series
Suppose I asked you the following question:

> "How many different ways can a world series go? How many combinations of wins can we have?"
  
The answer is a total of 70 games. It shouldn't be difficult to find this, but I wanted to approach this problem with several different languages. This is mostly just for practice, but if someone else stumbles upon this and is learning a new language, maybe it can be helpful somehow?
