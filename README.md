# world-series
Suppose I asked the question:
  "How many different ways can a world series go? How many combinations of wins can we have?"
The answer, in total, is 70. It shouldn't be difficult to find this, but I wanted to approach this problem with several different languages. This is mostly just for practice, but if someone else stumbles upon this and is learning a new language, maybe it can be helpful somehow?
